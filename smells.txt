Questions:

1.) The code smells for this question appears to be duplicate method. The refactoring created a new method which allowed the long winded code to be condensed into a single line. This refactoring method is called the extract method.

2.) No question

3.) 

4.) To eliminate the code smells duplicate code, we just put the code into a for loop and iterated over the loop four times. We also had to change the break to break out of the outer loop rather than breaking from the inner loop. 

5.) No question

6.) We once again encountered a code smells that was duplicate code when using the Copy/Paste Detector. We refactored the code to extract method so that the we could get rid of the duplicate code.
